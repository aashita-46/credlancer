Problem Statement
Unreliable Payments: Students and freelancers often fear scams or not getting paid for gigs.
Fake Mentors: Beginners struggle to find genuine mentors, since anyone can claim expertise.
Lack of Verifiable Proof: Students complete projects, internships, and courses, but have no tamper-proof way to showcase these skills to recruiters.
💡 Solution
SkillTrust is a decentralized platform built on Aptos blockchain that provides:

Secure Escrow Payments: Smart contract-powered escrow ensures freelancers get paid safely
Verified Mentors: Blockchain-backed mentor verification with NFT badges
Skill Badges: Soulbound NFTs for completed gigs/projects as tamper-proof resumes

📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

Node.js (v18 or higher)

bash   node --version

Aptos CLI

bash   curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3
   aptos --version

Petra Wallet (Browser Extension)

Install from Petra Wallet
Create an account

bash   git --version
🚀 Installation & Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/skilltrust.git
cd skilltrust
Step 2: Initialize Aptos Account
bash# Initialize Aptos CLI with testnet
aptos init --network testnet

# This creates .aptos/config.yaml with your account details
# Save your private key securely!
Step 3: Setup Move Smart Contracts
bash# Create the Move project structure
mkdir -p move/sources

# Copy the Move.toml, escrow.move, and badges.move files to:
# - move/Move.toml
# - move/sources/escrow.move
# - move/sources/badges.move
Step 4: Deploy Smart Contracts
bash# Make deploy script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy.sh
Expected output:
🚀 Starting SkillTrust Smart Contract Deployment...
✅ Move.toml created
🔨 Compiling smart contracts...
✅ Compilation successful
🧪 Running tests...
🌐 Deploying to Aptos Testnet...
✅ Deployment successful!
📝 Contract deployed at: 0x1234...
⚙️  Initializing contracts...
✅ Contracts initialized!
🎉 Deployment complete!
Save the contract address from the output!
Step 5: Setup Backend
bash# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cat > .env << EOF
APTOS_NETWORK=testnet
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
APTOS_NODE_URL=https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1
APTOS_FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet.aptoslabs.com
PORT=5000
EOF

# Start the backend server
npm start
Backend should be running on http://localhost:5000
Step 6: Setup Frontend
bash# Open new terminal
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the React app
npm start
Frontend should open at http://localhost:3000
